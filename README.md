This project utilizes the NFLâ€™s Next Gen Stats player tracking data from the 2022 season to explore and develop metrics related to fumbles. The team employed advanced machine learning models, including tree-based algorithms, to predict fumble occurrences and identify key factors influencing these events. By integrating feature engineering and comprehensive data analysis, the project aims to offer NFL teams actionable insights that can enhance their understanding of fumble dynamics and inform better defensive strategies.
